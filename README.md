Creating something new...
Building a multi-threaded web server is a complex but rewarding project. Below is a high-level guide to creating a basic version of this project in C++. I will provide an outline of the steps and core components required. The actual implementation can be quite extensive, but this guide should give you a solid foundation to start with.

1. Setting Up the Project
Create a new C++ project in your preferred development environment or IDE. You can organize the project into multiple files for better structure (e.g., main.cpp, server.cpp, client_handler.cpp, logger.cpp, etc.).

2. Implementing Socket Programming
You will use the socket API provided by the operating system to handle network communication. Hereâ€™s a basic structure:
